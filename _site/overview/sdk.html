                <p>What follows is an overview of the sdk, and the features it provides for app development.  It is worth noting from the outset that the SDK is no silver bullet; it is well suited to building lightweight apps that operate on data to perform actuation or data visualisation; more complex apps (e.g. those that require significant user interaction, or complex data processing) will inevitably require developers to fall back to text editors and raw code; there are good examples of databox apps written in a variety of languages at the main <a href="https://github.com/me-box">databox repo</a></p>

<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-databox-app">anatomy of a databox app</h3>

<p>There isn’t all that much to a databox app.  It is simply:</p>

<ol>
  <li>some executable code that interacts with components on a databox to perform a task.</li>
  <li>a manifest file that describes the app and specifies the datastores that it requires access to.</li>
</ol>

<p>A datasource is anything that creates data e.g: iot devices such as smartplugs or bulbs, social media data feeds, system logs, webcam images and so on.<br />
We are not presecriptive about the language that an app is written in, only that it conforms to the databox apis for registering with the system and reading and writing from/to datastores.  All databox apps are run inside docker containers connected to a network that appropriately restricts interaction with other databox components.</p>

<p>The  end-to-end databox app workflow process can be broken down into several stages:</p>

<p>The SDK is principally concerned with the first 5 i.e:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write the app</li>
  <li>Test the app</li>
  <li>Create a manifest file to describe the app</li>
  <li>Construct put the app in a docker container</li>
  <li>Publish the app to a databox app store</li>
</ol>

<p>The purpose of the databox SDK is to streamline each of these stages to get you building and deploying apps as efficiently as possible.</p>

<h3 id="the-anatomy-of-an-sdk-built-app">the anatomy of an sdk-built app</h3>

<p>If you have not yet read the overview of the databox, it may be worth doing so before continuing.  Apps built in the SDK is loosely modelled on flow-based programming.  Apps are built as directed graph of black boxes with well-defined input and output interfaces (ports) connected by edges. We are principally concerned with data flow; data (information packets) flows along edges, in and out of nodes and is processed and modified along the way.  There are 3 main types of node that you’ll work with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>datasources</li>
  <li>processors</li>
  <li>outputs</li>
</ul>

<p>Data sources map directly to their databox counterparts (i.e: originators of data i.e. iot devices such as smartplugs or bulbs, social media data feeds, system logs, webcam images and so on).</p>

<p>Processors are nodes that operate on data (e.g filtering, extracting, formatting, transcoding, reducing etc.). The most general processor node is a ‘function’ node which can be used to run abitrary javascript on input data. Processing nodes may have more than one output.</p>

<p>Outputs are the endpoints of a flow, they with typically perform some kind of actuation (turn a bulb on, send a tweet) or display (present a visualisation, graph etc).</p>

<p>All nodes in the SDK provide interfaces for configuration - these can be very rich, and may operate as comprehensive tools in their own right.   For example the ‘uibuilder’ processing node provides a vector-based graphs tool for attaching incoming data to components of an svg image.  Nodes also come with comprehensive help; perhaps the most important is an overview of the data schemas that they expect and/or output.</p>

<p>All code developed in the SDK is in Javascript, executed in nodejs.</p>

<h3 id="testing-an-app">testing an app</h3>

<p>The databox sdk provides mock data to test apps against during the development process.  When you test a flow, all input data sources will emit this test data, and, where possible, you will be able to inpect simulated output (for example the ‘bulb’ output node will show a webpage with a bulb that will turn on or off in response to data). The databox sdk also provides a ‘debug’ node which is crucial for testing an app prior to publication.  The outputs from all nodes in a flow can be hooked up to a debug node to inspect output data, which can be paused and restarted at any time.</p>
